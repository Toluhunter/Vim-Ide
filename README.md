# VIM IDE

## Description

While Vim is known for its efficiency and customizability, it is often considered a bare bones editor. That being said, Vim IDE takes things to the next level by transforming Vim into a comprehensive integrated development environment. By adding features such as intelli-sense, code completion, syntax highlighting, Git support, and support for multiple filetypes, Vim IDE allows developers to work with greater efficiency and productivity, while still maintaining the flexibility and control that Vim is known for. The result is a powerful coding experience that can be accessed from any device capable of running a terminal, including servers, Linux machines, and even mobile phones.
